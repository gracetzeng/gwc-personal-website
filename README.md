# Personal Website Project

Personal website developed for Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program 2022. Besides using class resources, I also spent hours outside of lectures teaching myself features of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS not covered in class to better customize my website. Incldues a home page, a portfolio of a few of my hobbies, a gallery to glimpse into my life, and an about page.
