      <p class="aboutMe">Hello! My name is Grace and I am a high school student. I am a prospective computer science (or perhaps computer engineering) major, and also hope to continue my passion for music and the arts! Ever since I took AP CS A my sophomore year, I've been super interested in computer science. I've always wondered how technology can help humans, and I hope that one day I will be able to use code to change people’s lives!</p>
        <p class="aboutMe">Regarding music, I’ve been playing violin for 11 years and other miscellaneous instruments for a few years. I participate not only in my school orchestra, my by school's extracurricular orchestra and a community orchestra. I've made countless friends through music programs (most of my current friends play an instrument) and I honestly do not know where I would be without music! </p>
        <p class="aboutMe">I have some other random hobbies that are my creative outlets. I enjoy photography and will snap a picture of the sky at any given moment (trust me, I have way too many photos of the sky on my phone). I like doodling, but I definitely do not do it enough. I also enjoy building structures in Minecraft! Who knew placing hundreds of blocks could feel so rewarding?</p>
