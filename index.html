      <h4>About me!</h4>
      <p>Hello! My name is Grace and I am a high school student. I am a prospective computer science (or perhaps computer engineering) major, and also hope to continue my passion for music and the arts! I’ve been playing violin for 11 years and other miscellaneous instruments for a few years. I love photography and I’ve been trying to get back into art. I hope that one day I will be able to use code to change people’s lives.</p>
